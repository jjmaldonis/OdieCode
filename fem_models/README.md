These models are the results of Jinwoo's HRMC simulations. The fem_exp* are the experimental fem results assosciated with each type of experiment, and desribed by Jinwoo below.


t0 : EAM only, no V(k)
t1 : V(k) from as-quenched sample
t2 : V(k) from 300C, 10 min annealed sample
t3 : V(k) from 300C, 60 min annealed sample
t4 : V(k) from 435C, 2 min annealed sample
t5 : V(k) the "trench" sample (unpublished. Will be published soon)

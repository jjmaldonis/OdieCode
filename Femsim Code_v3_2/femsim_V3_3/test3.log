1. Reading simulation parameters from file Al92Sm8.fem.

2. Reading sample atoms with description:
The atom position after MC movement!!!                                                              

Shifting center of the model from (13.0247, 13.0509, 12.9824) to (0, 0, 0) for rotations.
Sample read finished.

3. Initializing intensity pixel positions.

	Pixel spacing of 2.49738 A in x is closer than the recommended
	minimum of the one-third the resolution, 5.33683 A.

	Pixel spacing of 2.49738 A in y is closer than the recommended
	minimum of the one-third the resolution, 5.33683 A.

	Pixel positions on the model are:
	-4.99475, -4.99475
	-4.99475, -2.49738
	-4.99475, 0
	-4.99475, 2.49738
	-4.99475, 4.99475
	-2.49738, -4.99475
	-2.49738, -2.49738
	-2.49738, 0
	-2.49738, 2.49738
	-2.49738, 4.99475
	0, -4.99475
	0, -2.49738
	0, 0
	0, 2.49738
	0, 4.99475
	2.49738, -4.99475
	2.49738, -2.49738
	2.49738, 0
	2.49738, 2.49738
	2.49738, 4.99475
	4.99475, -4.99475
	4.99475, -2.49738
	4.99475, 0
	4.99475, 2.49738
	4.99475, 4.99475

	Pixel positions calculated on a square array.

4. Simulation setup and parameters:
Sample data:
	The sample size is:
	x(-13.000000, 13.000000), y(-13.000000, 13.000000), z(-13.000000, 13.000000)
	The sample contains 400 atoms of 2 different elements.
	There are 368 atoms with Z = 13.
	There are 32 atoms with Z = 62.

Image data:
	Q_aperture=0.038100
	Rotations: 4 in phi, 2 in theta, and 4 in psi.  Total rotations: 36
	|k|=0.120000->0.860000,has 37 steps
	Size of image is:
	x(-13.000000, 13.000000), y(-13.000000, 13.000000)
	Number of pixels per image: 25


Total number of intensity samples: 900

5. Allocating memory for computations.
	Memory allocated.

6. Calculating the intensity and average over rotations of sample.
	Using the g2(r, r') algorithm.
	Delta r' is 0.001 Angstroms, so
	r' is divided into 16011 steps in the cylinder.
	Rotation: phi=1.570795 	 theta=1.047197 	 psi=1.570795
	Rotation: phi=1.570795 	 theta=1.047197 	 psi=3.141590
	Rotation: phi=1.570795 	 theta=1.047197 	 psi=4.712385

7. Calculating the variance.

8. Writing output files.
	Wrote *.out
	Wrote *rota_stat.txt.
	Wrote *scatfunc.txt.
	Wrote *inte03.txt and *inte06.txt.
	Wrote *int.txt.
